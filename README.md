## Get rich finding transcendental patterns hidden in stock prices

*This is work in progress*

This project aims to collect stock prices and (hopefully!) obtain some useful information from it which could somehow guide speculative trading.

**WARNING:** Technical Analysis is one of several *pseudo-sciences* listed at [Rational Wiki](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/List_of_pseudosciences).

Chances are that sophisticated statistical analysis done by sophisticated Big Data tools (even Machine Learning / Deep Learning) will do very little for your aim of getting rich harvesting patterns from stock/commodity prices.

Well, at least you have a chance of playing with a real life use case based on nearly realtime streaming data.

### Current status

Does not even compile. We are copying ideas from the example in Java and slowly converting it to Scala observing the current API.
